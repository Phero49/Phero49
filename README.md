# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Pemphero Mkuka

I‚Äôm a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about building scalable apps, SDKs, and developer tools.  
My work focuses on **clean architecture**, **maintainable code**, and **giving creators control** through well-designed systems.  
Having run my own startup, I understand the realities of shipping under pressure and balancing innovation with reliability.
